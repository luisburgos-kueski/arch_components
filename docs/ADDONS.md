# Addons

An "addon" is an external library we could use in different places of our architecture layers to get more out of our features. Shared libraries are addons by definition.

> ðŸš¨ Some addons are currently living inside our main app repo as internal packages.
> We plan to move these packages to it's own external repo. 

Current available addons:
- [kevent_tracker](https://github.com/kueski-dev/kevent_tracker)
- [kapp_behavior](../packages/kapp_behavior/README.md)
- [kdevice_info_collector](https://github.com/kueski-dev/kdevice_info_collector)

Notes:
- You could decide to use none, one or more addons into your project.

## Addons Overview

Here is a brief description on what you can get out of the current available addons.
